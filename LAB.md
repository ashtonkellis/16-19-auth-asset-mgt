Explain terms such as RPS, latency, and percentiles to your reader, and describe what the numbers mean in terms of the performance of your app. Explain the differences between latency and response time. Explain the type of scenarios you used (in the case of this lab's MVP, only a POST request to `/api/signup` is all you have to address). 

While not required, **try to include the charts that Artillery generates to aid in visualization of your written analysis**. 

## Stretch Goals
Explore the Artillery docs linked above to add more complex configurations and Javascript code to your tests. Try to figure out how to test your additional routes, and include those additional test results in your analysis.
