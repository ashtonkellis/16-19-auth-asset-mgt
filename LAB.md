## Submission Instructions
* Continue from previous authorization labs.
* Submit on canvas: 
  * an observation: i noticed that out process.env.SECRET_KEY is visible in our test.env.js once we push to GitHub? Is this on purpose, or should we be taking steps to hide this piece of info?
  * your original time estimate: 5 hours (12:30 start time)
  * how long you spent: 7 hours, but i took a short nap in there.
  * a link to your pull request: 
  * a link to your deployed Heroku URL: https://ashton-lab16-19.herokuapp.com/
